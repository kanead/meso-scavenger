This repository provides a code to solve the scavenging community model for three different sets of parameter values and a code to plot the time-series output.

1. The Matlab code "solvescavengingmodel.m" was written in Matlab R2021b and solves the dynamical system given by Eq. (1). The scenarios 1,2 and 3 correspond to Figure 1 in the main text, Figure S1 in the supplement and Figure S2 in the supplement respectively.
2. The R project code plots the results for the main scenario and two sensitivity analyses. The data are contained within the .csv files.
